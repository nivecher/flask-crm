# Flask CRM Application

## Purpose

A Flask-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application for managing donors and donations.

## Project Guidelines

This project adheres to the TIGER style of development:

*   **Lean:** Maintain a concise codebase, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
*   **Efficient:** Write performant code, mindful of resource management.
*   **Modern:** Use current Python features and libraries (e.g., `factory-boy` for tests).
*   **Strictly Organized:** Follow a clear project structure, separating concerns (blueprints, services, forms).
*   **Aggressively Refactored:** Continuously improve code by eliminating redundancy.

### Workflow

*   **Testing:** All new features require thorough unit tests, with the goal of 100% coverage.
*   **Dependencies:** Pin all dependency versions in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.
*   **Commits:** Changes are not autocommitted and require manual verification and approval.
